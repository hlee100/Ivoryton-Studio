        <p>I love taking pictures of people. The most important thing about my pictures is emotion, then motion. The result is a collection of warm expressive pictures. I photograph weddings with a photojournalist style, shooting a lot of pictures in black and white and color. At first, I'll be engaging with you to take pictures, then growing distant to record things as they happen. Making sure I capture all the great moments.</p>

        <p>Because I work to record what's happening, I will encourage you to do things. The action taking place in the reception makes great pictures because people smile and are having genuine fun.</p>

        <p>I like to attend the wedding Rehearsals so it gives extra time for us to get comfortable before your wedding photography begins. I like to think you'll use my wedding photographs as gifts for your family and friends.</p>

        <p>My work has been published in The Hartford Courant's Northeast Magazine, The New York Times, Washington Post, Leica Photography International, and Fine Woodworking. "Sharpening the Saw" is in the Yale Art Gallery's permanent collection.</p>

        <p>For the last 3 years I've taken photographs of the games; the players, coaches, and fans at the Middletown Summer Hoopfest. Produced by Malik Pemberton and his 1Family Inc. organization in Middletown, Connecticut.</p>

        <p>My goal has been to record some of the effort, spirit, and grace played out in the games at Hoopfest. In 2010 this project was supported by a grant from the Middletown Commission on the Arts. I enjoy being the photographer for the Hoopfest tournament and plan to do it again next year. Certainly, these pictures have a historic value and hopefully, some of them attain a poetic worth.</p>
